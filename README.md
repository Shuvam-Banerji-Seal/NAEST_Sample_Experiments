# Experiment 01: Refractive Index of Water

## Overview

This experiment aimed to determine the refractive index of water using two different methods: minimum deviation and critical angle.

## Experimental Setup

- A rectangular transparent plastic box filled with water
- A mobile torch for the light source
- A cardboard sheet for mounting the prism
- Ruler, protractor, and adhesive tape for setup
- Smartphone for angle measurements and documentation

## Procedure

1. **Minimum Deviation Method**:
   - Mount the cardboard sheet as a prism inside the water box.
   - Adjust the angle of incidence until the deviation of the light ray is minimized.
   - Measure the angle of incidence, angle of refraction, and angle of minimum deviation.
   - Calculate the refractive index of water using Snell's Law and the formula for minimum deviation.

2. **Critical Angle Method**:
   - Adjust the angle of incidence gradually until the refracted ray is parallel to the water surface.
   - Measure the critical angle of incidence when total internal reflection occurs.
   - Calculate the refractive index of water using the critical angle and Snell's Law.

## Results

- Minimum deviation method: $\mu_{water} = 1.306$
- Critical angle method: $\mu_{water} = 1.346$

## Analysis

The obtained refractive index values show consistency between the two methods, confirming the optical properties of water. Any discrepancies were analyzed, considering experimental errors and inaccuracies.

# Experiment 02: Total Internal Reflection

## Overview

This experiment focused on observing and measuring total internal reflection at the interface between water and a transparent plastic box.

## Experimental Setup

- Rectangular transparent plastic box partially filled with water
- Mobile torch for the light source
- Ruler and protractor for angle measurements
- Smartphone for documentation

## Procedure

1. **Setting Up**:
   - Fill the plastic box with water to a certain level.
   - Position the light source and observe the light behavior at the water-air interface.

2. **Measurement of Critical Angle**:
   - Gradually increase the angle of incidence until total internal reflection occurs.
   - Measure the critical angle at which total internal reflection begins.

## Results

- Critical angle for total internal reflection: $\theta_{critical} = 48\degree$

## Analysis

The observed critical angle confirms the phenomenon of total internal reflection at the water-air interface. The result aligns with theoretical expectations and demonstrates the optical behavior of light.

# Experiment 03: Discrepancies in Prism Angle

## Overview

This experiment investigated the discrepancies between the presumed angle and the actual angle of the water prism.

## Experimental Setup

- Rectangular transparent plastic box filled with water
- Mobile torch for the light source
- Ruler and protractor for angle measurements
- Smartphone for documentation

## Procedure

1. **Setting Up**:
   - Position the cardboard sheet as a prism inside the water box.
   - Ensure the prism angle is set according to experimental requirements.

2. **Measurement and Analysis**:
   - Measure the angle of the prism using a protractor.
   - Compare the measured angle with the presumed angle.
   - Analyze sources of discrepancies, including experimental errors and inaccuracies.

## Results

- Measured prism angle: $\theta_{measured} = 60\degree$
- Presumed prism angle: $\theta_{presumed} = 45\degree$

## Analysis

The significant difference between the measured and presumed prism angles indicates potential errors in experimental setup or angle measurement. Factors contributing to inaccuracies were analyzed, including instrument calibration, angle estimation, and setup stability.
